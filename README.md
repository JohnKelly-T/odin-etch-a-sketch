# Etch-A-Sketch 

A simple interactive Etch-A-Sketch web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
Created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Foundations curriculum.

## 🖱️ Project Overview

This project replicates the classic Etch-A-Sketch toy where users can draw on a grid using their mouse. The app allows you to:

- Draw on a grid using mouse movements
- Clear the drawing by resetting the grid
- Change the color of the grid squares
- Adjust the grid size dynamically

## 💡 Core Skills Practiced

- **DOM manipulation** – dynamically generating a grid and updating it based on user input  
- **Event handling** – capturing mouse movements to draw on the grid  
- **CSS Flexbox** – structuring the drawing area to make it responsive  
- **JavaScript functions** – handling the logic for grid resizing and clearing  
- **User interaction** – managing inputs to update the state of the drawing area and grid  
- **Bresenham's Line Algorithm** – solving the issue of broken lines when drawing by ensuring smooth, continuous lines even with cursor jumps  

### ✨ Features

- Drawing on a responsive grid with mouse input
- Ability to change grid size (e.g., from 1x1 to 100x100)
- Color change for drawing, with an option to reset back to the default grid
- **Rainbow Mode** – lets the user draw with colors cycling through the rainbow, making the brush colorful and fun
- **Bresenham's Line Algorithm** – smooths out broken lines by connecting the dots between the user's mouse movements, creating continuous lines
